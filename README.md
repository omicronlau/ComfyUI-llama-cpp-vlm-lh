## Common Questions

It is recommended to run workflows in separate blocks for generation, avoiding combined workflows like prompt generation + image generation, which can lead to high resource usage.

### 1. Model Loading Issues

**Reasons**:
- Model file doesn't exist or path is incorrect
- llama-cpp-python version is too low
- Missing corresponding mmproj file

**Solutions**:
- Check model file path
- Update llama-cpp-python to the latest version
- Ensure mmproj file matches the model

### 2. Out of Memory (OOM) Issues

**Reasons**:
- Model is too large, exceeding VRAM capacity
- Context length is set too large
- Multiple large models running simultaneously

**Solutions**:
- Reduce `n_gpu_layers` value
- Decrease `n_ctx` value
- Use a smaller model
- Try CPU mode if GPU memory is insufficient
- Lower image `max_size` for VLM tasks

### 3. Slow Inference Speed

**Reasons**:
- Model is too large
- GPU layers setting is too low
- Hardware performance limitations
- Unrestricted system_prompts word count

**Solutions**:
- Use a smaller model
- Increase `n_gpu_layers` value
- Reduce `n_ctx` value
- Close unnecessary applications
- Add word count limit, such as within 300 words, fewer words means faster inference

### 4. Poor Generation Quality

**Reasons**:
- Inappropriate model selection
- Poor prompt quality
- Unreasonable parameter settings

**Solutions**:
- Use a more suitable model for the task
- Optimize prompts with more detailed instructions
- Adjust temperature, top_p, and other parameters
- Use appropriate prompt templates

- **4-6GB VRAM**: Compatible mode, using CPU

### 2. Custom Parameters

For advanced users, you can manually adjust the following key parameters:

- **n_ctx**: Context length, affects the length of text that can be processed
