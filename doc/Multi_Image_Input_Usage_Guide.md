"Amy, is the system ready?" I turned to ask my AI assistant.

"Yes, Doctor. The quantum teleportation device is ready, awaiting your instructions."

I took a deep breath and pressed the start button. Blue ripples appeared in the air, and a light ball slowly formed in the center of the device. This was the first attempt at quantum teleportation in human history.

Suddenly, an alarm sounded. "Warning! Energy fluctuation anomaly!"

I rushed to the console, fingers flying across the keyboard. "Stabilize the energy field!"

The light ball began to become unstable, and the surrounding equipment started to vibrate. I had to make a choice: continue the experiment or stop immediately?

"Doctor, safety protocol recommends immediate termination." Amy's voice was calm and firm.

"No, we've come this far." I gritted my teeth and adjusted the parameters.

The light ball stabilized, and a flash of light passed. When I opened my eyes again, I found myself standing in another laboratory, with a 2050 calendar hanging on the wall.

Success! I made history.
